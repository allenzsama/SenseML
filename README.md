# SenseML
SenseML is a Spark Machine Learning Framework based on Scala and Spark. It provides feature engineering functions for auto feature generation, feature extension, hyper parameter tuning etc. It both supports high-level APIs for full-stack and low-level APIs for customization, which greatly ease the development of Machine Learning on big data. 

SenseML是一个基于scala、spark的机器学习框架，可以通过简单配置实现自动特征计算、特征组合扩展、特征选择等特征工程组件，以及超参数的调优等，既支持高级API的全栈式调用，也可以调用各组件API进行定制化开发，以简化大规模机器学习任务的开发。目前SenseML主要有Feature模块，支持特征工程相关功能。
